This is a simple PHP web application that contains an example of a Security Misconfiguration (XXE) vulnerability and the main goal of this app is to describe how a malicious user could exploit it.

## What is XXE?

Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents. External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks.

The main goal of this app is to discuss how **XXE** vulnerabilities can be exploited and to encourage developers to send Pull Requests on how they would mitigate these flaws.

## Setup

To start this intentionally **insecure application**, you will need [Docker][docker install] and [Docker Compose][docker compose install]. You must type the following commands to start:

```sh
cd owasp-top10-apps/task3/vinijr-blog
```

```sh
make install
```

Then simply visit [localhost:10004][app] ! 😆
