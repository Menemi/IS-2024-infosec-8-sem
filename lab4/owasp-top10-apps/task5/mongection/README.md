## What is Injection?

Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attackerâ€™s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

The main goal of this project is to discuss how **NoSQL Injection** vulnerabilities can be exploited and to encourage developers to send Pull Requests on how they would mitigate these flaws.

## Setup

To start this intentionally **insecure application**, you will need [Docker][docker install] and [Docker Compose][docker compose install]. You must type the following commands to start:

```sh
cd owasp-top10-apps/task5/mongection
```

```sh
make install
```

Then simply visit [localhost:10001][app], as exemplified below:

## Get to know the app ðŸ’‰

To properly understand how this application works, you can follow these simple steps:

- Register a new user via front-end.
- Login as this user via front-end.

* Register another user now using command line:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:10001/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"name":"bob", "email":"bob@example.com", "password":"bobisboss"}'
```

- Login as this second user now using command line:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:10001/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"email":"bob@example.com", "password":"bobisboss"}'
```
