## What is Broken Access Control?

Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access to other users' accounts, view sensitive files, modify other usersâ€™ data, change access rights, etc.

The main goal of this app is to discuss how **Broken Access Control** vulnerabilities can be exploited and to encourage developers to send Pull Requests on how they would mitigate these flaws.
