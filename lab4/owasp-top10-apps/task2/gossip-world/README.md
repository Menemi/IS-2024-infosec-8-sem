## What is Cross-Site Scripting?

XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victimâ€™s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.

The main goal of this app is to discuss how **Cross-Site Scripting** vulnerabilities can be exploited and to encourage developers to send Pull Requests on how they would mitigate these flaws.

## Setup

To start this intentionally **insecure application**, you will need [Docker][docker install] and [Docker Compose][docker compose install]. You must type the following commands to start:

```sh
cd owasp-top10-apps/task2/gossip-world
```

```sh
make install
```

Then simply visit [localhost:10007][app] ! ðŸ˜†

## Get to know the app ðŸ’„

To properly understand how this application works, you can follow these simple steps:

- Create a new user
