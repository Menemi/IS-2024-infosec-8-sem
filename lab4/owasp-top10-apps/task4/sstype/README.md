SSType is a simple Python web application that contains an example of a Server-Side Template Injection vulnerability in Tornado. In this example, a specific subcategory of Injection will be exemplified: Server Side Injection or SSTI.

## What is Injection?

Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attackerâ€™s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

The main goal of this project is to discuss how **Server-Side Template Injection** vulnerabilities can be exploited and to encourage developers to send Pull Requests on how they would mitigate these flaws.

## Setup

To start this intentionally **insecure application**, you will need [Docker][docker install] and [Docker Compose][docker compose install]. You must type the following commands to start:

```sh
cd owasp-top10-apps/task4/sstype
```

```sh
make install
```

Then simply visit [localhost:10001][app], as exemplified below:

## Get to know the app ðŸ’‰

To properly understand how this application works, you can do some search using `name` as a query string using a [browser](http://localhost:10001/?name=Vitor) or using `curl` in a terminal:

```sh
curl http://localhost:10001/?name=Vitor
```
